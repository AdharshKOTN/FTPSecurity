It is suggested to launch this program in linux with two terminals. You must have the latest version of python3 and simple-crypt (a python library) installed.

For these two terminals, navigate to the client and server directory, respective to the terminal.

First launch server.py in cloned terminal with the command: python3 server.py

Then launch client.py in the other terminal with command: python3 client.py

Now a client prompt will appear. Here is where you will login with the below credentials.

Login information

(case-sensitive)
Username: admin
Password: admin1
Encryption Password: password1

Exit | Send File | Access File: you can use any of these 3 commands. These are not case-sensitive. Include the space between words.

When the file prompt is shown, provide one of these two filenames: test.txt or serverfile.txt (Case Sensitive)

You should be able to view the server output on the server terminal.

Feel free to explore this code and use any secret commands or users I placed.
